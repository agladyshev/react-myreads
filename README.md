# MyReads Project
## MyReads is a study project from Udacity React Nanodegree.

MyReads is a book tracking app. The app allows you to search for new books to read and add them to you bookshelves. You can also move books between shelves.
The book state is synchronised between routes. So when you search for the book and it is already in your library, the UI will represent that.

To run the app locally:
* have npm or yarn installed
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
